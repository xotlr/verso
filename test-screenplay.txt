FADE IN:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A cozy neighborhood coffee shop. SARAH (30s, writer) sits at a corner table, laptop open, staring at a blank page.

JAKE (35, barista) approaches with a fresh cup of coffee.

                    JAKE
          Another refill?

                    SARAH
          (sighs)
          My fifth today. Still can't write a 
          single word.

                    JAKE
          Writer's block?

Sarah nods. Jake sits down across from her.

                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          What's the story about?

                    SARAH
          That's the problem. I don't know.

                    JAKE
          Start with what you know. Write about 
          this moment. Two strangers in a coffee 
          shop.

Sarah looks at Jake, then at her screen. She starts typing.

                    SARAH (V.O.)
          "Two strangers in a coffee shop. One 
          searching for a story, the other 
          offering unexpected wisdom..."

She smiles. The words begin to flow.

FADE OUT.
